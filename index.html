I practiced measuring weight and later rechecked clients’ medicines with Nurse Stella, learning the 				scientific names. Before lunch, I practiced taking BP and improved with practice. In the afternoon, we sorted papers and suggested ideas for Christmas decorations 			using recycled or indigenous materials.</p>

                        <p>Because of the heavy rain, Eunice and I arrived a bit late. Since Fridays have fewer clients, we helped by sorting papers and writing client information alphabetically until around 10:45 AM. After an early lunch, the nurse left for a breast cancer awareness discussion, so we used the free time to study. By 4:00 PM, the BHWs let us go home since there were no more tasks or clients.</p>

                    <p>Hello! I am Liana an aspiring health professional currently undertaking my Work Immersion at the Babag II Barangay Health Center. This website serves as a digital portfolio, showcasing my 10-day journey, including the diverse tasks I performed, the vital skills I acquired, and my personal reflections on this enriching experience.</p>
                    <p>My time at the center has solidified my interest in public health and community service. I hope this journal inspires others to appreciate the hard work of our dedicated health workers and the profound importance of accessible community healthcare.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you gain insights into the world of barangay health services!</p>
